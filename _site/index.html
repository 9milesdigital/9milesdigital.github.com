			<p>This is a quick post to show you how to open up external website links within a pop-up window (without adding extra non semantic mark-up to your HTML code).</p>
			<p>In the past I’ve heard a lot of people talk about adding either custom attributes or using existing attributes such as <code>rel</code> as a hook for your JavaScript code to find links that should open in a pop-up window. I disagree, and suggest using Regular Expressions (regexes) along with some procedural code to help figure this out for you (it will save you the time and hassle of adding this extra mark-up yourself).</p>
			<p>This solution is an updated version. The previous version was recklessly using <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/brackets.html">capture groups</a> when really they should have been using non-capturing groups (as the brackets in the following solution are solely for applying <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html">quantifiers</a> and <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/optional.html">optional items</a>). The reason you should use capturing groups sparingly is to do with performance and saving the regex engine from having to remember content within the capturing groups. The Regular Expression checks for things like whether the URL is an SSL protected URL and uses a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html">negative look ahead assertion</a> to make sure that it doesn’t incorrectly match URL’s that <em>appear</em> to be external (e.g. they start with a http) but in fact actually are links to the current website URL (this happens a lot with Content Management Systems where a user will copy and paste the full URL to one of their own pages).</p>
			<p>I’ve ended up tweaking the regex again to take into account files that don’t start with http but should still open in a pop-up window. For example if a website links to a self hosted PDF file it might store it in the following directory path <code>Assets/Documents/MyFile.pdf</code>. First thing I did was add a case-insensitive modifier flag.</p>-->
